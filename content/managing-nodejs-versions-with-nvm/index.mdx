Managing different Node.js versions across projects can be a challenge. NVM (Node Version Manager) simplifies this by allowing you to install, switch, and manage multiple versions effortlessly. In this guide, weâ€™ll explore how to install NVM, use it effectively, and adopt best practices to streamline your workflows.

> This guide is designed for developers of all levels, with actionable insights and examples to help you master NVM.

## What is NVM?

NVM is a version manager for Node.js that lets you:

- Install and switch between multiple Node.js versions.
- Set a default Node.js version for global use.
- Use project-specific Node.js versions.

By leveraging NVM, you can avoid version conflicts between projects and ensure your development environment aligns with production.

## Installing NVM

### Step 1: Install NVM

Run the following command to install NVM:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
```

For Wget users:

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.4/install.sh | bash
```

> Note: Replace `v0.39.4` with the latest version from NVM's [GitHub page](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Step 2: Verify Installation

Restart your terminal or run:

```bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
```

Verify installation:

```bash
nvm --version
```

If you see the version number, NVM is installed and ready to use!

## Using NVM: Common Commands

### 1. List Available Node.js Versions

See all available Node.js versions:

```bash
nvm ls-remote
```

### 2. Install a Specific Version

Install a specific version of Node.js:

```bash
nvm install <version>
```

Example: Install Node.js 16.20.0:

```bash
nvm install 16.20.0
```

Install the latest LTS version:

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

### 3. List Installed Versions

List installed Node.js versions:

```bash
nvm ls
```

### 4. Switch Between Versions

Switch to a different Node.js version:

```bash
nvm use <version>
```

Example:

```bash
nvm use 18.0.0
```

### 5. Set a Default Node.js Version

Set a default version for all terminal sessions:

```bash
nvm alias default <version>
```

Example:

```bash
nvm alias default 16.20.0
```

### 6. Run a Specific Node.js Version Temporarily

Run a specific version for a single command:

```bash
nvm run <version> <script>
```

Example:

```bash
nvm run 14.17.0 my-app.js
```

### 7. Uninstall a Node.js Version

Remove a Node.js version:

```bash
nvm uninstall <version>
```

Example:

```bash
nvm uninstall 14.17.0
```

## NVM and `.nvmrc` for Project-Specific Versions

Use a `.nvmrc` file to enforce a specific Node.js version for a project.

### Steps:

1. Create a `.nvmrc` file in your project directory.
2. Add the desired Node.js version (e.g., `16.20.0`).
3. Run:

```bash
nvm use
```

NVM will automatically read the `.nvmrc` file and switch to the specified version.

---

## Example Workflow

Scenario:  
Youâ€™re working on two projects:

- **Project A** requires Node.js 14.
- **Project B** requires Node.js 18.

Steps:

1. Install the required versions:

   ```bash
   nvm install 14
   nvm install 18
   ```

2. For **Project A**:

   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Create a `.nvmrc` file with:

     ```text
     14
     ```

   - Run:

     ```bash
     nvm use
     ```

3. For **Project B**:

   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Create a `.nvmrc` file with:

     ```text
     18
     ```

   - Run:

     ```bash
     nvm use
     ```

NVM ensures the correct version is used in each project.

## Best Practices for Using NVM

1. **Always Use LTS Versions for Stability**: LTS versions are production-ready and stable for most applications.
2. **Use `.nvmrc` for Project Consistency**: This ensures all team members use the same Node.js version.
3. **Regularly Update NVM and Node.js Versions**: Benefit from the latest features and security fixes.
4. **Test Applications on Different Versions**: Use NVM to test your application on multiple Node.js versions for compatibility.
