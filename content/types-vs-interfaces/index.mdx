One of the most frequently asked questions about TypeScript is whether we should use **types** or **interfaces**. The answer to this question, like many programming questions, is: "It depends." In some cases, one has a clear advantage, but often, they can be used interchangeably.

In this article, we’ll dive deep into the key differences and similarities between types and interfaces and explore scenarios where one is preferred over the other.

> **Key Takeaway**: Both types and interfaces have their place. Your choice will depend on the context, functionality, and personal or team preferences.

## Basics of Types and Interfaces

### **Types and Type Aliases**

The `type` keyword in TypeScript is used to define the shape of data. Some common use cases include:

- **Primitive Types**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, etc.
- **Union Types**: Combining types with the `|` operator.
- **Advanced Types**: Mapped types, conditional types, etc.

**Example: Defining Type Aliases**

```typescript
type MyNumber = number;

type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};
```

### **Interfaces**

An interface defines a **contract** that an object must adhere to. It is often used to define the structure of objects in TypeScript.

**Example: Interface Definition**

```typescript
interface Client {
  name: string;
  address: string;
}
```

---

## Differences Between Types and Interfaces

While they can often be used interchangeably, here are notable differences:

### **1. Primitive Types**

- **Use `type`** for primitives like `string` or `number`.
- **Interfaces cannot alias primitive types.**

```typescript
type Address = string; // Valid
interface Address {} // Error
```

---

### **2. Union Types**

- Union types can only be defined using `type`.
- There’s no equivalent for union types in interfaces.

**Example:**

```typescript
type Transport = "Bus" | "Car" | "Bike";
```

---

### **3. Function Types**

Both can define function types, but `type` is more concise and offers advanced features.

**Using `type`:**

```typescript
type AddFn = (num1: number, num2: number) => number;
```

**Using `interface`:**

```typescript
interface IAdd {
  (num1: number, num2: number): number;
}
```

---

### **4. Declaration Merging**

- Interfaces support **declaration merging**; types do not.

```typescript
interface Client {
  name: string;
}
interface Client {
  age: number;
}
// Merged interface: { name: string; age: number }
```

Attempting the same with `type` results in an error.

---

### **5. Extending Types and Interfaces**

- **Interfaces**: Use `extends`.
- **Types**: Use the intersection operator `&`.

**Extending an Interface:**

```typescript
interface VIPClient extends Client {
  benefits: string[];
}
```

**Extending a Type:**

```typescript
type VIPClient = Client & { benefits: string[] };
```

---

### **6. Conflict Resolution**

Interfaces detect and throw errors on conflicting properties, whereas types merge conflicts.

**Example of Conflict in Type:**

```typescript
type Person = { name: string };
type Staff = Person & { name: number }; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to 'number'.
```

---

## Advanced Type Features

TypeScript offers advanced features that are exclusive to `type`:

- **Mapped Types**: Automatically transform types.
- **Conditional Types**: Create types based on conditions.
- **Template Literal Types**: Compose types using string literals.

**Example: Mapped Type**

```typescript
type Getters<T> = {
  [K in keyof T as `get${Capitalize<string & K>}`]: () => T[K];
};
type Client = { name: string; address: string };
type ClientGetters = Getters<Client>;
// { getName: () => string; getAddress: () => string; }
```

## When to Use Types vs. Interfaces

### **Use Interfaces When:**

- You need declaration merging.
- You want to extend third-party library types.
- You prefer object-oriented design with `extends`.

### **Use Types When:**

- You’re defining primitives, unions, or tuples.
- Advanced type features like mapped or conditional types are required.
- You need more expressiveness or functional programming paradigms.

---

## Conclusion

In many scenarios, types and interfaces are interchangeable, and the choice boils down to **personal preference** or **specific project requirements**. While interfaces are great for object-oriented paradigms and declaration merging, types shine with their flexibility and advanced type features.
