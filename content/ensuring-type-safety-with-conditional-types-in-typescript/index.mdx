TypeScript provides powerful tools for ensuring both runtime and type-level safety. One such tool is **conditional types**, which allow us to define types that depend on a given condition. In this article, we'll explore how to use them effectively to guarantee correct return types in functions.

## Building the Function Step by Step

Consider the following simple function:

```ts
function flipGreeting(greeting: unknown) {
  return greeting === "goodbye" ? "hello" : "goodbye";
}
```

This function takes a greeting and flips it: if you pass `"goodbye"`, it returns `"hello"`, and vice versa. However, there are a few issues:

> **Lack of Type Safety:** Since `greeting` is `unknown`, TypeScript can't infer what values it can accept.
> **Return Type Inference:** The function always returns either `"hello"` or `"goodbye"`, but TypeScript sees the return type as a generic `string`.Let's refine this using **generics and conditional types** .

## Adding a Generic Type

To enforce stricter type safety, we introduce a **generic type parameter** `TGreeting`:

```ts
function flipGreeting<TGreeting extends "hello" | "goodbye">(
  greeting: TGreeting,
) {
  return greeting === "goodbye" ? "hello" : "goodbye";
}
```

### Why Use a Generic Type?

> The `extends "hello" | "goodbye"` constraint ensures that only `"hello"` or `"goodbye"` can be passed.If a developer tries to pass `"hi"` or `"farewell"`, TypeScript will flag it as an error.

## Introducing a Conditional Return Type

Currently, our function returns a **union type** (`"hello" | "goodbye"`), but we can be more precise. Using a **conditional type** , we explicitly map `"hello"` to `"goodbye"` and vice versa:

```ts
function flipGreeting<TGreeting extends "hello" | "goodbye">(
  greeting: TGreeting,
): TGreeting extends "hello" ? "goodbye" : "hello" {
  return greeting === "goodbye" ? "hello" : "goodbye";
}
```

### Understanding the Return Type

> If `TGreeting` is `"hello"`, the return type is `"goodbye"`.If `TGreeting` is `"goodbye"`, the return type is `"hello"`.At this point, **TypeScript provides autocomplete support** , helping developers quickly see valid input and output values.

## Handling TypeScript's Inference Limitations

Despite our improvements, TypeScript still throws an error:

```rust
Type '"hello" | "goodbye"' is not assignable to type 'TGreeting extends "hello" ? "goodbye" : "hello"'.
```

### Why Does This Happen?

> TypeScript isn’t smart enough to infer that our function logic correctly enforces the return type. It sees the possible return values as `"hello" | "goodbye"`, rather than mapping inputs to specific outputs.The Fix: Using `as any`To override TypeScript's strict inference, we can use a **type assertion** :

```ts
function flipGreeting<TGreeting extends "hello" | "goodbye">(
  greeting: TGreeting,
): TGreeting extends "hello" ? "goodbye" : "hello" {
  return (greeting === "goodbye" ? "hello" : "goodbye") as any;
}
```

> This may seem unusual, but it’s a **necessary workaround** when working with conditional return types in functions.

## Extracting a Type Helper for Clarity

To make the code cleaner, we can **extract the conditional type** into a separate helper type:

```ts
type OppositeGreeting<TGreeting> = TGreeting extends "hello"
  ? "goodbye"
  : "hello";
```

Now, we can use this helper in our function:

```ts
function flipGreeting<TGreeting extends "hello" | "goodbye">(
  greeting: TGreeting,
): OppositeGreeting<TGreeting> {
  return (
    greeting === "goodbye" ? "hello" : "goodbye"
  ) as OppositeGreeting<TGreeting>;
}
```

### Why Use a Type Helper?

> It improves readability by **separating logic from type definitions** .If we ever need to **reuse this logic** elsewhere, we can easily do so.

## Key Takeaways

- **Use generics** to enforce input constraints (`TGreeting extends "hello" | "goodbye"`).

- **Leverage conditional types** to correctly map return values (`TGreeting extends "hello" ? "goodbye" : "hello"`).

- **Understand TypeScript's limitations** —sometimes, it can’t infer relationships between runtime and type-level code.

- Use **Use `as any` or a type helper** to work around inference issues when necessary.
  By applying these techniques, you can **write type-safe, predictable functions** that guide developers with **proper autocompletion and error prevention** .
