TypeScript’s `as const` annotation is a powerful yet straightforward tool that makes values deeply readonly. Unlike the typical `as` keyword, often associated with type assertions (which can be misleading or unsafe), `as const` is entirely type-safe. It simply provides TypeScript with additional information, ensuring your code is precise and immutable where needed.

Let’s break down `as const`, understand how it differs from similar constructs, and see practical examples of its usage.

> **Key Takeaway**: `as const` is a compile-time directive that provides immutability and precise type inference without runtime overhead.

## What Does 'as const' Do?

When you append `as const` to a value, you inform TypeScript to:

- Treat the value as deeply readonly. Every nested property becomes immutable.
- Infer literal types for the value’s contents wherever possible.

This makes `as const` a compile-time directive that disappears at runtime, unlike `Object.freeze`.

### Example 1: Deep Readonly with `as const`

```typescript
const settings = {
  theme: {
    color: "blue",
  },
} as const;

// Error: Cannot assign to 'color' because it is a read-only property.
settings.theme.color = "red";
```

Contrast this with `Object.freeze`:

```typescript
const settings = Object.freeze({
  theme: {
    color: "blue",
  },
});

// Surprisingly, this works because Object.freeze only affects the top level.
settings.theme.color = "red"; // No error at compile-time
```

## How `as const` Works with Arrays

Another key feature of `as const` is how it transforms arrays into readonly tuples. This prevents operations that would alter the structure or content of the array.

```typescript
const numbers = [10, 20, 30] as const;

// Error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly [10, 20, 30]'.
numbers.push(40);

// Error: Cannot assign to '0' because it is a read-only property.
numbers[0] = 50;
```

Without `as const`, TypeScript infers `numbers` as `number[]`, allowing mutable operations like `push`.

---

### Example 2: Literal Type Inference

Using `as const` ensures that TypeScript infers the most specific literal types rather than broader types.

```typescript
const userInfo = {
  role: "admin",
  permissions: ["read", "write"],
};

// Inferred type:
// role: string
// permissions: string[]
console.log(userInfo.role);

const userInfoLiteral = {
  role: "admin",
  permissions: ["read", "write"],
} as const;

// Inferred type:
// role: "admin"
// permissions: readonly ["read", "write"]
console.log(userInfoLiteral.role);
```

This narrow inference is particularly useful for creating type-safe enums or constant values without the `enum` keyword.

---

### Example 3: Tuples in Return Values

When working with functions that return arrays, `as const` can ensure the returned value is inferred as a tuple. This is useful in contexts like React’s state management.

```typescript
declare function useToggle(): [boolean, () => void];

const useToggleState = () => {
  const [isOn, toggle] = useToggle();

  return [isOn, toggle] as const;
};

// TypeScript infers the return type as:
// readonly [boolean, () => void]
```

---

## Comparing `as const` with `as`

The standard `as` keyword is often used to force TypeScript into accepting a specific type, which can lead to runtime errors if misused:

```typescript
const element = {} as HTMLButtonElement;

// No error at compile-time, but will fail at runtime.
element.click();
```

In contrast, `as const` doesn’t lie to TypeScript—it merely enhances the type inference system by locking down values and making them readonly.

---

### Example 4: Function Props and `as const`

When defining object literals for function props, `as const` ensures the types remain as narrow as possible.

```typescript
const buttonProps = {
  type: "submit" as const,
  onClick: () => console.log("Submitted"),
} as const;

// Inferred:
// type: "submit"
// onClick: () => void
console.log(buttonProps.type);
```

## Why Use `as const`?

**Advantages:**

1. **Immutability**: Prevents unintended mutations, leading to safer and more predictable code.
2. **Precise Inference**: Helps TypeScript infer literal types and readonly structures.
3. **Zero Runtime Overhead**: Unlike `Object.freeze`, it only affects the compile-time behavior.

**Common Use Cases:**

- Defining constant configurations or settings.
- Locking down API responses or constants in tests.
- Improving type inference for props and return values.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Deep Readonly**: `as const` makes entire objects or arrays immutable.
2. **Literal Type Inference**: It ensures values are inferred as narrowly as possible.
3. **Type-Safe**: Unlike `as`, it doesn’t create runtime risks.
4. **Disappears at Runtime**: There’s no performance cost for using `as const`.

By using `as const`, you can make your TypeScript code safer, more expressive, and easier to maintain—all without sacrificing runtime performance.
