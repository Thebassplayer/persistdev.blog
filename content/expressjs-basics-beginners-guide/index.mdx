Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. If you're getting started with Node.js and want to create web servers, Express.js is a powerful tool that simplifies and speeds up the process. This guide will walk you through the basics of Express.js to help you get started.

> **What is Express.js?**  
> Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js. It is designed to make web development faster and easier by providing a simple API for building web servers and applications. With Express.js, you can:
>
> - Build RESTful APIs quickly.
> - Create dynamic web pages and serve static files.
> - Handle HTTP requests with minimal configuration.

Express.js is widely used in the Node.js ecosystem due to its lightweight nature and extensibility, allowing developers to add middleware, routes, and more, to build complex applications with minimal code.

## Setting Up Express.js

Before you start using Express.js, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you haven’t installed them yet, visit the [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org) and follow the installation instructions.

Once Node.js is installed, you can create a new project and install Express.js using npm:

```bash
mkdir my-express-app
cd my-express-app
npm init -y
```

This command initializes a new project and creates a `package.json` file that keeps track of your project’s dependencies and configuration.

Next, install Express.js:

```bash
npm install express
```

This will add Express.js to your project’s dependencies.

## Creating a Basic Express Server

Once Express.js is installed, you can create your first server. Create a new file called `app.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Route handler for the root URL
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello, World!");
});

// Start the server
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

### Explanation:

- **Import Express**:

  ```javascript
  const express = require("express");
  const app = express();
  ```

  `express()` creates an instance of an Express application.

- **Define a Route**:

  ```javascript
  app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.send("Hello, World!");
  });
  ```

  `app.get('/', callback)` defines a route that listens for GET requests to the root URL (`/`). The callback function `(req, res) => { ... }` runs when this route is accessed and sends back a response ('Hello, World!').

- **Start the Server**:
  ```javascript
  app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
  });
  ```
  `app.listen(port, callback)` starts the server on the specified port and runs the callback when the server is ready.

### Running the Server

To start your server, run:

```bash
node app.js
```

If everything is set up correctly, you’ll see a message: "Server is running on http://localhost:3000". Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you’ll see the message "Hello, World!".

## Understanding Middleware

Middleware functions are the heart of Express.js and provide a way to execute code, modify requests and responses, end the request-response cycle, and call the next middleware in the stack. Middleware can be used for various purposes, such as logging, authentication, and handling errors.

### Adding Middleware

Here’s an example of how to use middleware:

```javascript
app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} request for ${req.url}`);
  next(); // Passes control to the next middleware or route
});
```

`app.use(middlewareFunction)` applies the middleware to every request that hits the server. In this case, the middleware logs the HTTP method and the URL of the request and then calls `next()` to pass control to the next middleware function or route handler.

### Built-in Middleware

Express.js provides several built-in middleware functions, such as:

- **express.json()**: Parses incoming JSON requests.
  ```javascript
  app.use(express.json());
  ```
- **express.urlencoded()**: Parses URL-encoded bodies (from HTML forms).
  ```javascript
  app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
  ```
- **express.static()**: Serves static files like HTML, CSS, and images from a directory.
  ```javascript
  app.use(express.static("public"));
  ```

## Creating Routes

In Express.js, you can define multiple routes to handle different endpoints and HTTP methods.

### Example of Different Routes

```javascript
app.get("/about", (req, res) => {
  res.send("About Page");
});

app.post("/submit", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Form Submitted");
});

app.put("/update", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Data Updated");
});

app.delete("/delete", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Data Deleted");
});
```

- **GET**: Used to retrieve information (e.g., a webpage or data).
- **POST**: Used to submit data to the server (e.g., submitting a form).
- **PUT**: Used to update existing data on the server.
- **DELETE**: Used to delete data from the server.

### Route Parameters

You can also define dynamic routes using parameters:

```javascript
app.get("/user/:id", (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});
```

`:id` is a route parameter that can match any value. Access it via `req.params`.

## Working with JSON

Express.js makes it easy to work with JSON data, which is commonly used in RESTful APIs. Here's an example:

```javascript
app.post("/api/data", (req, res) => {
  const data = req.body;
  res.json({ message: "Data received", data });
});
```

Make sure to use `express.json()` middleware to parse JSON requests:

```javascript
app.use(express.json());
```

This setup allows your server to accept JSON data in POST requests and respond with JSON objects.

## Error Handling

Error handling in Express.js is straightforward. You can define an error-handling middleware like this:

```javascript
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack);
  res.status(500).send("Something went wrong!");
});
```

This middleware catches errors thrown in routes or other middleware functions. You can define custom error messages and set appropriate HTTP status codes.

## Structuring an Express App

For small projects, placing everything in a single file (`app.js`) is fine. However, as your application grows, you may want to organize your code better:

- **Create a routes directory**: Separate your routes into files for clarity.
- **Use Controllers**: Move business logic into separate functions to keep routes clean.
- **Middleware**: Store middleware in a middleware directory for modularity.

### Example Project Structure

```plaintext
my-express-app/
├── app.js
├── routes/
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── users.js
├── controllers/
│   ├── userController.js
├── middleware/
│   ├── logger.js
└── package.json
```

## Conclusion

Express.js is a powerful and easy-to-use framework for building web applications and APIs with Node.js. Understanding its basic components—like routing, middleware, and error handling—lays the foundation for creating complex, scalable applications. With this guide, you should now have a working knowledge of Express.js.
