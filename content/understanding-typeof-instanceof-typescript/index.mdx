In TypeScript, `typeof` and `instanceof` are operators for runtime type checks, each suited to different use cases. Let’s explore how they work, examine practical examples, and understand their limitations and warnings.

## 1. typeof Operator

The `typeof` operator checks the type of a variable at runtime, returning a string like `"string"`, `"number"`, `"boolean"`, `"object"`, or `"undefined"`. It’s mainly used for checking the types of simple values.

### Real-World Use Case for typeof

Imagine a function processing user input that could be a number (age), a string (name), or a boolean (active status). Using `typeof`, we handle each input type accordingly.

#### Example

```typescript
function processUserInput(input: string | number | boolean) {
  if (typeof input === "string") {
    console.log(`Hello, ${input}!`); // Treats input as a name
  } else if (typeof input === "number") {
    console.log(`You are ${input} years old.`); // Treats input as an age
  } else if (typeof input === "boolean") {
    console.log(`User is ${input ? "active" : "inactive"}.`); // Treats input as a status
  } else {
    console.log("Unknown input type.");
  }
}

processUserInput("Alice"); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"
processUserInput(30); // Output: "You are 30 years old."
processUserInput(true); // Output: "User is active."
```

In this example:

> `typeof` allows us to distinguish the input’s type and handle it appropriately. This is helpful in form handling, configuration settings, or any code where user input might vary in type.

### Limitations and Warnings with typeof

- **Only Works with Primitive Types**: `typeof` is limited to identifying simple types. It can’t distinguish between arrays and objects or identify custom types (e.g., `typeof []` and `typeof {}` both return `"object"`).
- **Misidentifies null as "object"**: Due to a legacy JavaScript quirk, `typeof null` returns `"object"`, which can lead to confusion in type-checking conditions.
- **Cannot Identify Class Instances or Interfaces**: Since `typeof` only works with values, it doesn’t recognize class instances or interface types. Use `instanceof` in those cases.

## 2. instanceof Operator

The `instanceof` operator checks if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor function. It’s useful when working with classes, especially in error handling and access control scenarios.

### Real-World Use Case for instanceof

Suppose we have an API call wrapped in a `try...catch` block. We want to handle network errors differently from validation errors, so we use `instanceof` to distinguish the error type and respond appropriately.

#### Example

```typescript
class NetworkError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "NetworkError";
  }
}

class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(message: string) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "ValidationError";
  }
}

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    // Simulate an error for demonstration
    throw new NetworkError("Failed to connect to server.");
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof NetworkError) {
      console.log("Please check your internet connection.");
    } else if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
      console.log("Data validation failed:", error.message);
    } else {
      console.log("An unknown error occurred:", error);
    }
  }
}

fetchData(); // Output: "Please check your internet connection."
```

In this example:

> `NetworkError` and `ValidationError` are custom error classes. `instanceof` identifies the error type, allowing us to respond with an appropriate message.

### Using instanceof with Custom Classes

A common use case is working with role-based systems. Suppose we have `User` and `Admin` classes. We might use `instanceof` to check if a user is an Admin to grant specific privileges.

```typescript
class User {
  constructor(public name: string) {}
}

class Admin extends User {
  constructor(
    name: string,
    public privileges: string[],
  ) {
    super(name);
  }
}

function checkUserRole(user: User) {
  if (user instanceof Admin) {
    console.log(`Admin privileges: ${user.privileges.join(", ")}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`User: ${user.name}`);
  }
}

const regularUser = new User("Alice");
const adminUser = new Admin("Bob", ["manage_users", "edit_content"]);

checkUserRole(regularUser); // Output: "User: Alice"
checkUserRole(adminUser); // Output: "Admin privileges: manage_users, edit_content"
```

### Limitations and Warnings with instanceof

- **Only Works with Class Instances**: `instanceof` is suitable only for objects created from a constructor or class. It won’t work with literals or primitive values (e.g., `number`, `string`).
- **Limited by Execution Contexts**: If objects are created in different JavaScript contexts (such as different iframes), `instanceof` may not work as expected because each context has its own set of constructors.
- **Does Not Work with Interfaces**: In TypeScript, interfaces are only used for compile-time checks and do not exist at runtime, so you cannot use `instanceof` to check if an object implements an interface.

## Key Differences Between typeof and instanceof

| Feature         | typeof                                | instanceof                                                   |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**     | Checks primitive types                | Checks if an object is an instance of a class or constructor |
| **Return Type** | Returns a string                      | Returns a boolean                                            |
| **Usage**       | Suitable for basic types              | Suitable for custom classes and objects                      |
| **Type Guard**  | Works with primitive types            | Works with classes and subclasses                            |
| **Limitations** | Can’t identify custom classes or null | Doesn’t work with primitive types                            |

## Summary

- Use `typeof` to determine the type of primitive values such as strings, numbers, and booleans, especially in scenarios like handling user input or parsing data.
- Use `instanceof` to verify an object’s class, particularly for custom error handling and permission systems in applications.

Together, `typeof` and `instanceof` provide essential tools for runtime type-checking in TypeScript. By understanding their limitations and best use cases, you can write more dynamic, type-safe code.
