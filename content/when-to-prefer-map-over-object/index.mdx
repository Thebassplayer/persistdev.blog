# When to Prefer Map Over Object in JavaScript

JavaScript objects are versatile, allowing you to group data together easily. But since ES6, the `Map` object has entered the scene, offering unique capabilities for certain use cases. While many developers default to using objects for everything, this can lead to performance and security issues.

In this article, we’ll explore the differences between `Object` and `Map`, their use cases, performance characteristics, and when you should choose one over the other.

---

## TL;DR

- Use **`Object`** for fixed, finite records like configuration objects or one-time use data structures.
- Use **`Map`** for dynamic dictionaries or hash maps with frequent updates, especially when keys aren't known ahead of time.
- **`Map`** is generally faster than `Object` for insertion, deletion, and iteration, and it consumes less memory.

---

## Why `Object` Falls Short as a Hash Map

### **Key Limitations**

1. **String-Only Keys**  
   `Object` keys must be strings or symbols. Non-string keys are converted to strings, leading to unexpected behavior:

   ```javascript
   const foo = [];
   const obj = { [foo]: "value" };

   console.log(obj); // { "": "value" }
   ```

2. **Inheritance Issues**  
   By default, objects inherit from `Object.prototype`, leading to unwanted properties and potential prototype pollution:

   ```javascript
   const hashMap = {}; // inherits from Object.prototype

   console.log(hashMap.toString); // [Function: toString]
   ```

   This can also cause name collisions when a user-defined property shadows an inherited one.

3. **Cumbersome API**  
   Common tasks like determining size, clearing properties, or checking existence are more complicated with objects compared to `Map`:

   ```javascript
   const obj = { a: undefined };

   console.log(Object.keys(obj).length); // 1 (size workaround)
   console.log(obj.hasOwnProperty("a")); // true
   ```

4. **Performance Overhead**  
   Objects require additional workarounds for tasks like iterating over keys or deleting properties.

## Why `Map` Excels for Hash Maps

### **Key Advantages**

1. **Flexible Key Types**  
   `Map` supports any data type as keys, including objects and functions:

   ```javascript
   const map = new Map();
   const key = {};
   map.set(key, "value");

   console.log(map.get(key)); // "value"
   ```

2. **Better Ergonomics**  
   `Map` offers dedicated APIs for common tasks:

   - `size`: Easily get the number of entries.
   - `clear`: Remove all entries in one operation.
   - `has`: Check if a key exists.
   - `get`: Retrieve a value associated with a key.

3. **Performance Benefits**  
   Benchmarks show that `Map` is faster than `Object` for most operations, especially as the number of entries grows.

   | Operation | Object   | Map    |
   | --------- | -------- | ------ |
   | Insertion | Slower   | Faster |
   | Deletion  | Moderate | Faster |
   | Iteration | Slower   | Faster |

4. **Memory Efficiency**  
   `Map` consumes less memory than an object of the same size.

## Performance Benchmarks

### **String Keys**

For non-numeric string keys, `Map` outperforms `Object` in all operations:

- **Insertion**: `Map` is initially twice as fast as `Object` but converges as the size grows.
- **Iteration**: `Map` maintains a consistent advantage.

### **Integer Keys**

For integer keys (e.g., `1`, `2`), objects can sometimes outperform `Map` due to V8 optimizations, particularly for small-sized objects. However, as size increases, `Map` regains its advantage.

### **Memory Usage**

`Map` consistently uses 20–50% less memory than `Object`.

## When to Use `Map` Over `Object`

### **Use `Object` When:**

- The structure has a **fixed set of properties** (e.g., a configuration object).
- You prioritize simplicity over performance.
- Keys are known and limited to strings or symbols.

### **Use `Map` When:**

- You need a **dynamic key-value store** with frequent updates.
- Keys are of diverse types (e.g., objects, numbers, or functions).
- Iteration order and performance are critical.
- You need a reliable size API or frequent key checks.

## Browser Compatibility

`Map` is widely supported in modern browsers, including IE 11 (though IE 11 is officially obsolete). Unless you're targeting legacy environments, you can safely use `Map`.

---

## Conclusion

`Map` is a better choice than `Object` for hash maps, offering more features, better performance, and fewer pitfalls. However, `Object` still excels as a simple record structure for finite, predefined fields. Understanding their differences will help you make more informed decisions in your JavaScript development.
