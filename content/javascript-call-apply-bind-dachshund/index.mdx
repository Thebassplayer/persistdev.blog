# JavaScript: call(), apply(), and bind()

## **“this” refresher**

In Object-Oriented JavaScript, we learned that in JS, everything is an object. Because everything is an object, we can set and access additional properties on functions.

Setting properties and methods to a function via the prototype is powerful—but how do we access them? That’s where `this` comes into play.

### **The `this` keyword**

Every function in JavaScript gets the `this` keyword automatically. It always refers to the object that invokes the function. However, this can sometimes lead to confusion when the reference to `this` is lost in nested functions or event listeners.

```jsx
const dachshund = {
  name: "Sausage",
  age: 3,
  bark: function () {
    return `Woof! I am ${this.name}, the dachshund!`;
  },
};

console.log(dachshund.bark()); // Woof! I am Sausage, the dachshund!
```

But what happens when `this` is misinterpreted? For example, in an event listener:

```jsx
const button = document.getElementById("barkButton");

button.addEventListener("click", dachshund.bark);
// `this` will now refer to the button, not the dachshund object.
```

To fix this, we can use **call()**, **apply()**, and **bind()**.

## call(), apply(), and bind() — explained

Functions in JavaScript are objects and come with built-in methods like `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` that allow us to control the value of `this`.

### **bind()**

The `bind()` method creates a new function with `this` explicitly set to a specific value.

Let’s see an example with our dachshund dog:

```jsx
const dachshund = {
  name: "Sausage",
  age: 3,
  bark: function () {
    return `Woof! I am ${this.name}, the dachshund!`;
  },
};

const logBark = dachshund.bark.bind(dachshund); // Binds `this` to dachshund
console.log(logBark()); // Woof! I am Sausage, the dachshund!
```

### **call()**

The `call()` method allows us to invoke a function immediately with a specified value of `this` and individual arguments.

```jsx
const dachshund = {
  name: "Sausage",
  age: 3,
  bark: function () {
    return `Woof! I am ${this.name}, the dachshund!`;
  },
};

function describeDog(food, activity) {
  console.log(`${this.bark()} I love eating ${food} and ${activity}.`);
}

describeDog.call(dachshund, "bones", "digging holes");
// Woof! I am Sausage, the dachshund! I love eating bones and digging holes.
```

### **apply()**

The `apply()` method is nearly identical to `call()`, but it expects arguments as an array.

```jsx
const dachshund = {
  name: "Sausage",
  age: 3,
  bark: function () {
    return `Woof! I am ${this.name}, the dachshund!`;
  },
};

function describeDog(food, activity) {
  console.log(`${this.bark()} I love eating ${food} and ${activity}.`);
}

describeDog.apply(dachshund, ["bones", "digging holes"]);
// Woof! I am Sausage, the dachshund! I love eating bones and digging holes.
```

## **Key differences between bind(), call(), and apply()**

1. **bind()**: Creates a new function and does not execute it immediately.
2. **call()**: Invokes the function immediately and takes arguments individually.
3. **apply()**: Invokes the function immediately and takes arguments as an array.

---

### **When to use these methods?**

- **bind()**: Use when you need a new function with a specific `this` value.
- **call()**: Use when you need to invoke a function with specific arguments immediately.
- **apply()**: Similar to `call()`, but useful when arguments are in array format.

Mastering `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()` will give you more control over your JavaScript code, making your functions more flexible and reusable.
