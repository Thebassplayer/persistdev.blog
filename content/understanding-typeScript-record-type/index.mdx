TypeScript’s `Record` utility type is a powerful tool to create mapped types concisely. With `Record`, you can specify the exact shape of an object by defining both the types of its keys and values, which is helpful when creating objects with specific keys and controlling the type of associated values.

> **What is the Record Type?**  
> In essence, `Record<K, T>` is a TypeScript utility type where:
>
> - `K` is a union of literal types representing the keys of the object.
> - `T` is the type for each value associated with those keys.

This type essentially creates an object type where all keys are of type `K`, and all values are of type `T`.

### Syntax:

```typescript
Record<K extends keyof any, T>
```

## Practical Examples of Record in Use

### Basic Usage

Let's start with a simple example where we create a `Record` type for an object that maps strings to numbers:

```typescript
const scores: Record<string, number> = {
  Alice: 10,
  Bob: 15,
  Charlie: 12,
};
```

Here, `scores` is an object where each key (a string) maps to a number.

### Restricting Keys with Literal Types

One of the strengths of `Record` is its ability to restrict keys to specific literal types. For instance, if you’re building an app with a finite set of supported languages, you can use `Record` to type-check that only those languages are used as keys:

```typescript
type Language = "en" | "es" | "fr";

const translations: Record<Language, string> = {
  en: "Hello",
  es: "Hola",
  fr: "Bonjour",
};
```

In this case, TypeScript enforces that the keys of `translations` are exactly `"en"`, `"es"`, or `"fr"`—no more, no less.

### Nested Record Types

The `Record` type is flexible enough to handle nested objects. Suppose you’re creating a configuration object for different environments, each with specific settings:

```typescript
type Environment = "development" | "staging" | "production";

type Config = {
  apiUrl: string;
  debug: boolean;
};

const envConfig: Record<Environment, Config> = {
  development: { apiUrl: "http://localhost:3000", debug: true },
  staging: { apiUrl: "https://staging.api.com", debug: false },
  production: { apiUrl: "https://api.com", debug: false },
};
```

This setup allows TypeScript to ensure that each environment has a corresponding `Config` object, with the `apiUrl` as a string and `debug` as a boolean.

### Using Record to Create Enum-like Structures

You can also use `Record` to create more structured, enum-like objects. For example, suppose you need a set of statuses for an order, each with a different description:

```typescript
type OrderStatus = "pending" | "shipped" | "delivered" | "returned";

const orderStatusMessages: Record<OrderStatus, string> = {
  pending: "Your order is pending.",
  shipped: "Your order has been shipped.",
  delivered: "Your order has been delivered.",
  returned: "Your order has been returned.",
};
```

## Combining Record with Other Utility Types

### Using Partial&lt;Record&lt;...&gt;&gt;

To allow a `Record` type with optional keys, you can use `Partial<Record<...>>`, making all properties optional:

```typescript
type FeatureFlags = "darkMode" | "betaUser" | "offlineSupport";

const features: Partial<Record<FeatureFlags, boolean>> = {
  darkMode: true,
  betaUser: false,
  // `offlineSupport` is optional here
};
```

### Combining Record with Readonly

To make a `Record` immutable, use `Readonly<Record<...>>`:

```typescript
type Currency = "USD" | "EUR" | "JPY";

const currencySymbols: Readonly<Record<Currency, string>> = {
  USD: "$",
  EUR: "€",
  JPY: "¥",
};

// Trying to modify this will throw an error
// currencySymbols.USD = "US$"; // Error
```

### Real-world Example: Permissions System

A more complex example could be a permissions system for an application where you define roles and their allowed actions:

```typescript
type Role = "admin" | "user" | "guest";
type Action = "read" | "write" | "delete";

const permissions: Record<Role, Action[]> = {
  admin: ["read", "write", "delete"],
  user: ["read", "write"],
  guest: ["read"],
};
```

Here, each role (key) has an array of allowed actions as its value, providing a type-safe way to define and manage permissions.

## Why Use Record?

Using `Record` has several advantages:

- **Type Safety:** Ensures objects conform to specific key-value requirements.
- **Code Clarity:** Documents and enforces the intended data structure.
- **Enhanced Readability:** Reduces the need for custom types or interfaces for simple maps, making the codebase cleaner.

> **When Not to Use Record**  
> While `Record` is very useful, it’s not always the best choice. For more complex, nested objects or when you need individual control over properties, consider using `interface` or `type` with more granular control.

## Summary

The `Record` type is incredibly versatile in TypeScript, enabling you to create structured, type-safe mappings in a clean and concise way. From language translations to role-based access control, `Record` can simplify and streamline your TypeScript code.

### Key Takeaways

- **Define Mapped Types:** `Record` allows you to specify both the keys and values of an object.
- **Restrict Keys:** Use literal types to ensure only specific values are allowed.
- **Combine with Utility Types:** `Record` can work with `Partial`, `Readonly`, and other utility types to add flexibility.

Using `Record` effectively can make your codebase cleaner, safer, and more maintainable.
