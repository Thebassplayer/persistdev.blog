TypeScript introduces powerful static type-checking capabilities that improve code quality and developer productivity. Among its standout features is **type narrowing**, a technique to refine and determine the type of a variable at runtime. This guide explores the concept of type narrowing, its importance, and how to apply it effectively in your projects.

---

## What is Type Narrowing?

Type narrowing refers to refining a variable's type to a more specific type within a scope. TypeScript achieves this by analyzing control flow and using type guards or assertions. By narrowing a variable's type, developers gain confidence about the operations and methods that can safely be performed.

### Example:

```typescript
function process(value: string | number) {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // TypeScript knows `value` is a string here.
  } else {
    console.log(value.toFixed(2)); // TypeScript knows `value` is a number here.
  }
}
```

Here, the `typeof` operator helps TypeScript narrow `value` to either `string` or `number` based on the condition.

---

## Why is Type Narrowing Important?

TypeScriptâ€™s strict type system prevents many runtime errors but can introduce ambiguity with union types like `string | number`. Type narrowing resolves this ambiguity, enabling safer and more precise code.

### Key Benefits:

- **Enhanced Safety**: Avoid runtime errors by ensuring variables are correctly typed.
- **Improved Readability**: Conditions double as documentation for handling different types.
- **Reduced Type Assertions**: Minimize explicit casting (`as`) by letting TypeScript infer types naturally.

## Techniques for Type Narrowing

### **1. Using `typeof`**

The `typeof` operator is commonly used for primitive types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `symbol`.

```typescript
function describe(value: string | number | boolean) {
  if (typeof value === "string") {
    console.log(`String: ${value.toUpperCase()}`);
  } else if (typeof value === "number") {
    console.log(`Number: ${value.toFixed(2)}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Boolean: ${value ? "true" : "false"}`);
  }
}
```

---

### **2. Using `instanceof`**

The `instanceof` operator narrows types to specific classes or object types.

```typescript
class Dog {
  bark() {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

class Cat {
  meow() {
    console.log("Meow!");
  }
}

function interact(animal: Dog | Cat) {
  if (animal instanceof Dog) {
    animal.bark();
  } else {
    animal.meow();
  }
}
```

---

### **3. Using Equality Checks**

Equality checks are useful for narrowing union types with literal values.

```typescript
function checkStatus(status: "success" | "error" | "pending") {
  if (status === "success") {
    console.log("Operation succeeded!");
  } else if (status === "error") {
    console.log("An error occurred.");
  } else {
    console.log("Operation is still pending.");
  }
}
```

---

### **4. Using Type Predicates**

Custom type guards return a boolean, helping TypeScript infer narrowed types.

```typescript
interface Fish {
  swim: () => void;
}

interface Bird {
  fly: () => void;
}

function isFish(animal: Fish | Bird): animal is Fish {
  return (animal as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}

function interactWithAnimal(animal: Fish | Bird) {
  if (isFish(animal)) {
    animal.swim(); // TypeScript knows this is a Fish.
  } else {
    animal.fly(); // TypeScript knows this is a Bird.
  }
}
```

---

### **5. Using `in` Operator**

The `in` operator checks for property existence and narrows types based on it.

```typescript
interface Car {
  drive: () => void;
}

interface Plane {
  fly: () => void;
}

function operate(vehicle: Car | Plane) {
  if ("drive" in vehicle) {
    vehicle.drive();
  } else {
    vehicle.fly();
  }
}
```

---

### **6. Discriminated Unions**

Discriminated unions use a common property (a "tag") to differentiate between types.

```typescript
interface Circle {
    kind: "circle";
    radius: number;
}

interface Rectangle {
    kind: "rectangle";
    width: number;
    height: number;

type Shape = Circle | Rectangle;

function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
    if (shape.kind === "circle") {
        return Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2;
    } else {
        return shape.width * shape.height;
    }
}
```

---

## Best Practices for Type Narrowing

- **Leverage Control Flow Analysis**: TypeScript often eliminates the need for explicit assertions.
- **Keep Checks Simple**: Write clear and readable conditions for easy understanding.
- **Avoid Over-Narrowing**: Over-complicating narrowing logic can make code harder to maintain.
- **Use Exhaustive Checks**: Ensure all possible cases are handled using `never`.

### Example:

```typescript
function handleShape(shape: Shape) {
  switch (shape.kind) {
    case "circle":
      console.log("Circle area:", Math.PI * shape.radius ** 2);
      break;
    case "rectangle":
      console.log("Rectangle area:", shape.width * shape.height);
      break;
    default:
      const _exhaustiveCheck: never = shape; // Error if new shape is not handled.
      throw new Error("Unhandled shape!");
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Type narrowing is an indispensable feature in TypeScript, enabling developers to handle complex types safely and effectively. By combining techniques like `typeof`, `instanceof`, custom type guards, and discriminated unions, you can write expressive, type-safe code that is both robust and maintainable.

Embrace type narrowing to unlock the full potential of TypeScript, and build applications that are safer and more reliable.
