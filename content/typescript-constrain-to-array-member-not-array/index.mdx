TypeScriptâ€™s powerful type inference system can sometimes be a double-edged sword. On one hand, it saves you from having to annotate everything manually; on the other, it may not always infer types as specifically as youâ€™d likeâ€”especially when it comes to arrays.

In this article, we'll explore how tweaking your generics can lead to more precise type inference, using a different example to illustrate the concept.

## The Problem: Inference on Entire Arrays

Imagine you want to create a function that defines a basket of fruits. You might start with something like this:

```typescript
const createFruitBasket = <T extends string[]>(fruits: T) => {
  return fruits;
};
```

At first glance, this seems like a straightforward approach. You provide an array of strings (fruit names), and TypeScript infers `T` to be a `string[]`. However, thereâ€™s a subtle catch: **Hereâ€™s your article formatted in **.mdx\*\* format for publishing:

In this article, we'll explore how tweaking your generics can lead to more precise type inference, using a different example to illustrate the concept.

## The Problem: Inference on Entire Arrays

Imagine you want to create a function that defines a basket of fruits. You might start with something like this:

```typescript
const createFruitBasket = <T extends string[]>(fruits: T) => {
  return fruits;
};
```
````

At first glance, this seems like a straightforward approach. You provide an array of strings (fruit names), and TypeScript infers `T` to be a `string[]`. However, thereâ€™s a subtle catch: TypeScript infers the type as just `string[]` rather than the specific literal types of the fruits you passed in.\*\*
For example, calling:

```typescript
const basket = createFruitBasket(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);
```

Results in `basket` being inferred simply as `string[]`â€”you lose the detail that itâ€™s specifically an array containing `"apple"`, `"banana"`, and `"cherry"`.

## A More Granular Approach: Constrain the Array Member

To capture the literal types of each element in the array, you need to shift your focus from the array as a whole to its individual elements. Instead of constraining the entire array, you can **constrain each member of the array** . Hereâ€™s how you might refactor the function:

```typescript
const createFruitBasket = <T extends string>(fruits: T[]) => {
  return fruits;
};
```

Now, when you call:

```typescript
const basket = createFruitBasket(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);
```

TypeScript infers `basket` as `("apple" | "banana" | "cherry")[]`.

> This small change tells the compiler to look at each element of the array, preserving the specific literal types rather than generalizing them all to `string`.

## Why This Matters

The lesson here is simple: **always opt for the lowest-level representation that captures your intent** .When you constrain a higher-level structure (like an array) without focusing on its constituents, you risk losing important type information. By specifying the constraint on the individual elements (i.e., `T extends string`), you provide TypeScript with the hint it needs to infer the most precise types possible.This approach is particularly useful when you rely on the **specific values** later in your code. Whether youâ€™re handling **configuration options, command names, or fruit names** , the precision in types can lead to **fewer bugs and more predictable behavior** .

## Conclusion

When working with generics in TypeScript, itâ€™s crucial to guide the compiler to infer types as deeply and accurately as possible.
In our **fruit basket** example, switching from a **generic array type** to a **generic element type** preserved the **literal values** of the array items.

> **Remember:** When given the choice, always constrain to the lowest level that represents the core values you care about.
