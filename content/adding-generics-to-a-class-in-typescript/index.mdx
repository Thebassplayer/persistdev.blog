> Generics in TypeScript are a powerful tool that allows us to create reusable and type-safe components, especially when dealing with dynamic types. This article explores how to incorporate generics into a class to ensure robust typing. We’ll also break down the example provided, explain the underlying mechanics, and discuss why this is a common pattern in both open-source libraries and application code.

## Understanding the Problem

Consider a simple `Component` class that needs to accept a set of properties (props) and store them internally. The goal is to maintain type safety when accessing these properties. Here's the initial implementation:

```tsx
export class Component<TProps> {
  private props: TProps;

  constructor(props: TProps) {
    this.props = props;
  }

  getProps = () => this.props;
}
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Adding a Generic Slot

The key to making this class reusable and type-safe is to introduce a generic type parameter `TProps`. This parameter allows TypeScript to infer the type of props dynamically based on the object passed to the constructor.

Here’s the breakdown:

- **`TProps`** acts as a placeholder for the type of props.
- When the class is instantiated, **`TProps`** is inferred from the provided argument.

For example:

```tsx
const component = new Component({ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 });
```

In this case, `TProps` is inferred as `{ a: number; b: number; c: number }`.

---

### 2. Ensuring Type Safety

The type `TProps` is used in:

- The `private` property `props` to store the passed data.
- The `getProps` method to ensure that the returned value matches the type of `props`.

This provides a stable and type-safe API. If we change the properties passed to the constructor, TypeScript automatically updates the inferred type, ensuring that our code remains consistent.

---

## Refining the Class Structure

While the original implementation works, it can be refined for better readability and alignment with how TypeScript infers types.

### Original Order

```tsx
export class Component<TProps> {
  private props: TProps;

  constructor(props: TProps) {
    this.props = props;
  }

  getProps = () => this.props;
}
```

### Revised Order

Reordering the class can make the flow of type inference clearer:

```tsx
export class Component<TProps> {
  constructor(props: TProps) {
    this.props = props;
  }

  private props: TProps;

  getProps = () => this.props;
}
```

This small change aligns the type inference chain:

1. **Constructor first:** Infers the type of `TProps`.
2. **Private property next:** Uses the inferred type for internal storage.

---

## Adapting to New Types

Let’s test what happens when the types change. Suppose we modify `a` to be a string:

```tsx
const component = new Component({ a: "1234", b: 2, c: 3 });
const result = component.getProps();

type tests = [
  Expect<Equal<typeof result, { a: string; b: number; c: number }>>,
];
```

In this case:

- `TProps` is inferred as `{ a: string; b: number; c: number }`.
- The method `getProps` returns this type, ensuring that any downstream code is aware of the updated structure.

## Why Use This Pattern?

### 1. Stability

Generics in classes infer types once during instantiation. This ensures type stability throughout the lifecycle of the class instance.

### 2. Reusability

By making the class generic, you can use it with any shape of props, making the code more flexible and reusable.

### 3. Common in Libraries

This pattern is widely used in open-source libraries (e.g., React components) to handle dynamic props while maintaining type safety.

## Conclusion

Generics in TypeScript offer an elegant solution for creating flexible and type-safe classes. By introducing a generic parameter (`TProps`) to our `Component` class, we ensured that the types of props were inferred accurately and consistently. This pattern is not just limited to open-source libraries but is equally beneficial in application code.

Mastering this approach will help you write more robust TypeScript code and better understand how type inference works in complex scenarios.
